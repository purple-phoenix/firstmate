#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Safe, home-scoped (re-)arm of the firstmate watcher, with honest verification.
#
# The watcher (bin/fm-watch.sh) blocks until it has an actionable wake to
# surface, then prints one reason line and exits. While state/.afk exists the
# daemon owns triage and the watcher exits on every wake for the daemon to
# classify. Reliability depends on arming through a mechanism that SURVIVES the
# call and NOTIFIES on exit, so firstmate must run this script as the harness's
# own tracked background task (e.g. run_in_background). Run it as its own
# standalone background task, never bundled onto the tail of another command.
# NEVER fire it and forget with a shell `&` inside another call: that backgrounded
# child is reaped when the call returns, leaving NO watcher running and a false
# "already running" off the dying process. That exact mistake silently took
# supervision down for ~30 minutes.
# On a harness with a PreToolUse-equivalent hook, bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh
# applies the command-position policy before the command runs; see
# docs/arm-pretool-check.md for the blessed tree and deny reason codes. It is a
# pre-execution seatbelt, not a substitute for the verification here.
#
# This script forks the watcher as a tracked child, then VERIFIES the outcome
# before it settles in. It confirms a watcher process is genuinely alive AND the
# liveness beacon (state/.last-watcher-beat) is fresh within FM_GUARD_GRACE (the
# single source of truth, shared with fm-watch.sh and fm-guard.sh), and prints
# exactly one unambiguous status line:
#   watcher: started pid=<N> (beacon fresh)              - it launched one and confirmed it
#   watcher: attached pid=<N> (beacon <age>s)            - arm mode found a live+fresh watcher
#                                                          holding the lock; this arm attaches and
#                                                          waits until that cycle ends
#   watcher: healthy pid=<N> (beacon <age>s)             - restart mode found a live+fresh
#                                                          watcher it did not own
#   watcher: FAILED - no live watcher with a fresh beacon  - could not confirm one
#   watcher: FAILED - arm cycle ended with no live successor while tasks are in flight
#                                                     - cycle died without a wake
#                                                       handoff and no healthy peer
# It NEVER reports started/attached/healthy off a stale beacon or a dead/reused pid: a
# stale-beacon or dead-pid holder either self-heals (the fresh child steals the
# dead lock per the singleton self-eviction/steal path and is confirmed) or this
# returns the FAILED line. On started it waits the child and propagates the wake
# reason; on attached it stays live until the identity-matched holder is no longer
# healthy, then exits zero when idle (no tasks) so the harness background-notify
# fires then (not as a false empty wake). When an arm cycle ends without a
# successor, without a wake handoff, and with tasks still in flight, it prints a
# FAILED line, writes state/.watcher-arm-dead for the guard to name, and exits
# non-zero so the death is loud (provider-outage gaps must not be silent). On
# restart-only healthy it exits zero after the duplicate child stands down. On
# FAILED it exits non-zero so the failure is loud. A live cycle already present
# means re-arm attaches - do not start a second watcher.
#
# --restart: stop ONLY this FM_HOME's watcher (the pid recorded in THIS home's
# state/.watch.lock) and own a fresh cycle, or report restart-only healthy if a
# live peer still holds the lock after the duplicate child stands down. It
# resolves and signals exactly that pid, so it can never touch another home's
# watcher. NEVER `pkill -f
# bin/fm-watch.sh`: that pattern matches every firstmate home's watcher
# (secondmate homes run the same script) and would kill siblings. Restart never
# takes the attach path.
